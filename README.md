# Personal Encryptor

I developed this text encryptor/decryptor during my spare time for fun.

The user can input a text and chose a password. Then the text is hashed into another meaningless text which can only be "decrypted" again using the correct password. Besides, the user can save the encrypted text as a separate file and load it again later to the program. Two users can exchange messages as files using this program and a mutually-agreed password.
