# Personal Encryptor

I developed this text encryptor/decryptor during my spare time for fun.

The user can input a text and chose a password. Then the text is hashed into another meaningless output which can only be "decrypted" using the correct password. Besides, the user can save the encrypted text as a separate file and load it later to the program. This way, multiple users can exchange messages as files using this program and a mutually-agreed password.
